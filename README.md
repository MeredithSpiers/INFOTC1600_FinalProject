Binary uses base 2 and can be very helpful for network analysts, security analysts, developers, and other IT professionals to understand because most of information you see on your computer is composed of bytes, as well as things like your computer's IP address. Each byte is composed of 8 bits. Each bit is either a 0 or 1, which is why it is base 2. If it was base 10, the available numbers would be 0-9. 

This tutorial is intended for people who want to learn more about IT and are new to viewing, adding, or subtracting numbers that are not base 10.
